# Getting Started with Spring Boot

Spring Boot makes it easy to create stand-alone, production-grade Spring-based applications that you can run with minimal configuration.

## What is Spring Boot?

Spring Boot is an opinionated framework built on top of the Spring Framework that simplifies the development of Spring applications by providing:

- Auto-configuration
- Embedded servers (Tomcat, Jetty)
- Production-ready features
- Simplified dependency management

## Creating Your First Application

### Prerequisites

- Java 17 or later
- Maven or Gradle
- Your favorite IDE

### Step 1: Initialize Project

You can use [Spring Initializr](https://start.spring.io/) to bootstrap your project:

```bash
curl https://start.spring.io/starter.zip \
  -d dependencies=web \
  -d name=demo \
  -d packageName=com.example.demo \
  -o demo.zip
```

### Step 2: Create a REST Controller

```java
@RestController
@RequestMapping("/api")
public class HelloController {
    
    @GetMapping("/hello")
    public String hello() {
        return "Hello, Spring Boot!";
    }
}
```

### Step 3: Run the Application

```bash
./mvnw spring-boot:run
```

Your application will start on `http://localhost:8080`.

## Key Features

1. **Auto-Configuration**: Automatically configures your application based on dependencies
2. **Standalone**: Runs independently without needing an external application server
3. **Production-Ready**: Built-in health checks, metrics, and monitoring

## Conclusion

Spring Boot dramatically reduces the boilerplate code and configuration needed to develop Spring applications, allowing you to focus on business logic.

Happy coding!
